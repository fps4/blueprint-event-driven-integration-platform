# Metrics

- Throughput per integration and tenant; queue lag; worker concurrency.
- Success/failure rates with error taxonomies (ingress, transform, egress).
- Latency (P50/P95) for async and sync flows; replay duration metrics.
- DLQ volume and replay counts; backfill activity.
- Cost per integration/per 1,000 messages (tagging + billing export).
